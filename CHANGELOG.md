# 5.0.1

This release contains minor improvements and fixes:

* Use 0 as tab index to allow tabbing through form fields.
* Support rendering forms using native form tag.
* Bugfix: Prevent selection of undefined items in lookup component.
* Allow tab content to be specified as tab children.
* Add a width prop to thumbnails.
* Allow omitting of onClick behavior for form list items.

# 5.0.0

We had to start at v5.0.0 because we messed it up with npmjs.org and published some tags earlier. npmjs.org does not allow to remove or alter previously published versions after the [leftpad desaster](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/).
